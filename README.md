**🌱 Village-Level Renewable Energy Microgrid Monitor**

Affordable IoT System for Rural Solar & Wind Microgrids

This project presents a low-cost, IoT-based Renewable Energy Microgrid Monitoring System designed for villages and rural communities.
It continuously monitors solar panel performance, wind turbine output, battery health, environmental parameters, and load usage, sending data to a cloud dashboard and generating alerts for safe, efficient microgrid operation.

The system is built using an ESP32 and multiple low-cost sensors to ensure reliability, real-time monitoring, and easy deployment in rural areas.
